# Research Hub — Orchestration State

Status: Active
Last updated: 2026-09-14
Owner: Chief Architect (Lead Architect)

**Sprint:** 2026-09-hub · **Mode:** 3 (Ultracode) · **Level:** L2 (all work streams)
**Design authority:** `llm/specs/2026-09-10-research-hub-design.md`
**Brief:** `llm/plans/2026-09-10-research-hub-orchestration-brief.md`

Machine-specific paths are never written here. `<canon checkout>` means the path
declared in `llm/governance/governance-delta.md` §Canon Location.

## Current position

**Phase 0 — Establish. CHECKPOINT 1 — STOPPED.** PR #9 is marked ready for the
owner's review once CI is green on the commit that records this. **No Phase 1
work starts without the owner's explicit go.**

## Done

- [x] §1 preconditions verified — all pass. Recorded in issue #7.
- [x] Issue **hub-000** (#7) opened; Mode 3 / L2 declared; labelled
      `governance`, `in-progress`, `priority-high`, `phase-0-establish`.
- [x] Branch `gov/establish-hub` cut from `main`; design doc and brief brought
      across; phd-milestones tarball moved out of the repo (brief §4 location),
      confirmed absent from the tree.
- [x] `/governance:establish`, steps 1–12:
  - Step 2 layout — governance, adr, specs, sprints, plans, memory bank declared;
    constitution, features, artifacts not declared (A1).
  - Step 10 — branch protection applied and verified (owner chose to mirror
    canon: PR required, 0 approvals, enforce_admins off); 32 labels created, 41
    total, verified.
  - Step 11 — `ci.yml` (canon SHA-pinned, v0.8.3); declared check command run
    locally: **4 of 4 PASS** (links, adr-index, adr-status, layout), both via the
    plugin and from the canon checkout.
- [x] ADRs 0001–0005 + index (Chief Architect).
- [x] Commits on `gov/establish-hub`: `ee59299` (design authority + scaffolding),
      `92fcc88` (routing rule, templates, CI gate), `effd377` (delta, ADRs).
- [x] **Draft PR #9** opened — L2, labels `gov-L2`, `governance`,
      `phase-0-establish`, `in-progress`. Closes #7.
- [x] Contracts: `chief-product-officer-phase-0.md`, `chief-reviewer-phase-0.md`
      (`fcdb1eb`; amended with the brief/design-doc conflicts to verify).
- [x] CI on PR #9 verified from the run log: `governance-checks` ran against the
      pinned canon and reported 4 of 4 PASS — no SKIP. `build` (tests) PASS.
- [x] **Chief Product Officer** delivered `llm/master-roadmap.md` (Phases 0–6,
      136 checkboxes, all unchecked) and `handoffs/chief-product-officer-phase-0.md`.
      Verified against its contract: only its two paths touched, no machine paths,
      governance checks 4 of 4 PASS.
- [x] **Chief Reviewer** report received and persisted verbatim to
      `handoffs/chief-reviewer-phase-0.md` (local only — not committed or posted
      until A1 is remediated, because it describes the exposure).
- [x] A1 verified independently by the Lead Architect (see Blocked).
- [x] ADR reconciliation applied and committed: A2, A3, A5, A6, A7, A10, A12,
      A16, A19, A20. Governance checks 4/4 PASS.
- [x] **A1 remediated** (owner-approved 2026-09-14): remote branch
      `handoff/research-hub` deleted 2026-09-15T02:51:24Z. See §Incident A1.
- [x] Delta (A13), `ci.yml` SHA pins (A14), memory bank (A11, A15) committed
      (`f4a32e9`). Issue #7 no longer carries the billing account ID (A16).
- [x] Chief Reviewer report committed (one commit SHA redacted, A10) and posted
      to PR #9.
- [x] **Chief Product Officer amendments** integrated for A2, A7, A9, A10, A17,
      A18, A19 — verified: only its two files changed, 137 checkboxes (A7 added one),
      all unchecked, no machine paths, governance checks 4/4 PASS. Left unchanged by
      decision: five factual mentions of the handoff branch or tarball (scope and
      history, no SHA), and three Q5 lines that remain accurate.

## In flight

Nothing.

## Blocked

Nothing blocks Phase 0. Incident A1 carries an owner follow-up outside this repository.

## Incident A1 — private material on a public branch

- **What:** the phd-milestones seed tarball (milestone tracker, committee
  material, VT policy — private per design doc §2) was committed on branch
  `handoff/research-hub` of this public repository.
- **Exposure window:** from the commit on 2026-09-10 until the branch was deleted
  at 2026-09-15T02:51:24Z.
- **How found:** Chief Reviewer, finding A1; verified independently by the Lead
  Architect (public repository; file served on that branch; commit on no other
  branch; no pull request ever opened from it; no forks).
- **Remediation:** owner chose to delete the remote branch; done. The branch path
  now returns 404. The out-of-repo copy was verified byte-identical first; the
  local branch is kept.
- **Residual:** the commit remains reachable by its SHA until GitHub
  garbage-collects it. Tarball retrievable through the commit: YES — the tarball is still retrievable through the commit (68565 bytes).
  The SHA is withheld from every public artifact (A10).
- **Owner actions outstanding:** (1) ask GitHub Support to remove cached views of
  the commit (the owner has the SHA); (2) decide whether anyone named in the
  committee material should be told.
- **Prevention:** ADR candidate C9 (incident runbook); review recommendation 5 (a
  secret and large-binary scan in `ci.yml`).

## Next

Owner, at Checkpoint 1 (details in the Checkpoint 1 report on PR #9):

1. Incident A1: request GitHub Support removal of cached views of the commit.
2. Rule on K1–K13, above all K2 and K13; confirm or reject Q5 by merging PR #9.
3. Review and merge PR #9.
4. Before Phase 1: create the GCP project, link billing (Blaze), set the ADC quota
   project; decide A3 (branch naming) and A7 (Constellize).

Lead Architect, after an explicit go: add `governance-checks` as a required status
check once it is green on `main`; open hub-001; write Phase 1 contracts that
encode the owner's rulings on K1–K13.

## Brief / design-doc / canon conflicts (owner decides at Checkpoint 1)

Raised by the Chief Product Officer and extended by the Chief Reviewer. The
delta ranks the design doc above the brief, so the roadmap and ADRs follow the
design doc; each item still needs the owner's word, because the brief and the
design doc are both the owner's own documents.

Brief vs design doc:

- **K1 — Buckets and Artifact Registry.** Brief: Phase 1. Design doc §11: content
  bucket Phase 2, private bucket Phase 3; Artifact Registry unassigned (first
  consumer is the Phase 3 gate).
- **K2 — Gate rewrites in the Phase 1 `firebase.json`.** Brief §4 says Hosting
  tolerates rewrites to a `hub-gate` service that does not yet exist.
  **VERIFIED false:** the Hosting REST reference (v1beta1 `CloudRunRewrite`)
  states that setting or updating the Hosting configuration fails if the Cloud
  Run service does not exist. Checkpoint 2 fails as briefed unless Phase 1 omits
  the rewrites until the gate exists.
- **K3 — Share routes.** Brief: built in Phase 3. §11: shares are Phase 4, and
  Q3 may cut them.
- **K4 — Bucket IAM test.** Required on every deploy by §12.1 and ADR-0005; the
  brief assigns it to no agent.
- **K5 — Satellite prefix.** Brief scopes identities to `cv/`, `phd-milestones/`;
  §4 uploads to `sources/<source>/`. IAM conditions match literal prefixes.
- **K9 — Dispatch stub.** Brief stubs the dispatch trigger in Phase 1; §11 has it
  in Phase 2 only.
- **K11 — Leak-check semantics.** Brief §4 (Phase 3): fail if any *path* under
  `dist-public` matches. Design doc §5: grep contents for any private slug.
  ADR-0005 follows §5.

Inside the brief:

- **K6 — Blaze timing.** §1 requires Blaze confirmed before Phase 1; §4 has it
  enabled at Checkpoint 2. (Design doc §10 Q2 sides with §1.)
- **K7 — Roadmap span.** §2 asks for a Phase 0–3 roadmap; §4 asks for 0–6. The
  roadmap covers 0–6.
- **K10 — Phase 3 ordering.** §3 runs the gate before infra; §4 launches them in
  parallel.

Brief vs canon:

- **K12 — Check-command path.** Brief §4 asks for "the real path on this machine"
  in the delta; canon permits exactly one machine path (the canon checkout) and
  forbids expanding it in the check command. The delta follows canon.

Inside the design doc:

- **K8 — Design doc internals.** §6 requires share-link tests while §11 defers
  shares to Phase 4; §11's share "list" operation is not defined in §6; §11
  Phase 6 both redirects from Pages and retires Pages; the header still pins
  governance v0.5, names the handoff branch, and misstates the authority
  hierarchy (the memory bank, not the delta, is rank 1); §10 Q4 names a third
  party in a public repository.
- **K13 — Dispatch contradiction.** §3 and §4 require each satellite to fire
  `repository_dispatch` at `website`, which needs a credential with Contents:
  write on `website` — contradicting §3's "a satellite never has write access to
  the hub" and principle 3. Recorded in ADR-0002; the owner decides the
  constraint before Phase 2.

## Decisions on the record

| # | Decision | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 | Domain `cusati.us` | ADR-0001; issue #7 |
| Q2 | New GCP project, intended id `cusati-hub`, personal account | ADR-0001 |
| Q5 | **Proposed:** Astro app moves under `site/`; `gate/`, `contract/`, `infra/` at root. Merging PR #9 accepts it. | ADR-0001 |
| — | Ownership chain on personal accounts, not institutional — survives graduation | Design doc §1; ADR-0001 |
| — | Branch protection mirrors canon (enforce_admins off) — owner, 2026-09-14 | Delta §Platform Enforcement Reality |
| — | Full label taxonomy + phase milestones — owner, 2026-09-14 | Delta §Milestone Labels |

## Assumptions (conservative choices, not §10 questions)

- **A1** — Artifacts slot (`docs/`) undeclared until its first content lands
  (Phase 2). `--layout` fails a declared path that does not exist; the
  checker's data-plane scan still covers `docs/` by default.
- **A2** — Phase 0 runs its two personas (CPO, Chief Reviewer) through the Agent
  tool. The generated ultracode workflow is reserved for the Phase 1–3 fan-out,
  where dependency waves exist.
- **A3** — Branch names follow the brief (`gov/…`, `feat/…`), not canon's
  `governance/…` and `feature/…` prefixes. Flag at Checkpoint 1.
- **A4** — Governance checks live in `ci.yml`, separate from `build.yml`. The
  Phase 1 infra contract (`.github/workflows/**`) must carve out `ci.yml`.
- **A5** — ADR statuses are `Accepted` per the brief; acceptance takes effect
  on merge.
- **A6** — `governance-checks` becomes a required status check only after a
  green run on `main`.
- **A7** — Constellize is not installed. The brief's delegations to its
  system-architect (Phase 1) and QA (Phase 3) personas cannot run as written.
  Raise at Checkpoint 1.
- **A8** — The Chief Reviewer charter records outcomes with `gh pr review`, but
  the brief forbids sub-agent gh mutations. The reviewer returns its review as a
  final report; the Lead Architect persists it verbatim and posts it to the PR,
  attributed to the Chief Reviewer role.
- **A9** — `/governance:establish` and the delta were run by the Lead Architect
  (top-level session), not a Repository Steward agent as brief §2 assigns. The
  steward agent has no Write, Edit or Skill tools, and establish needs the
  owner's interactive approval for GitHub-side changes, which only the
  top-level session can obtain. Recorded so auditor independence can be traced
  (review A22).
- **A10** — The commit SHA that carried the tarball is redacted from every public
  artifact, including the otherwise-verbatim Chief Reviewer report, until GitHub
  confirms the cached views are purged.

## ADR candidates

- **C1** — Satellite → hub dispatch credential. `repository_dispatch` needs a
  GitHub-side credential; a GCP service account cannot hold it. A per-satellite
  PAT is a long-lived credential. Decide before Phase 2. (ADR-0002)
- **C2** — Leak-check matching rules and the derived outputs they cover
  (sitemap, RSS, search index, OG images). Decide in Phase 3. (ADR-0005)
- **C3** — Branch naming convention for this repo vs canon (A3).
- **C4** — Content bucket as published-content store vs §12.5 rebuild-from-repo.
- **C5** — Branch protection and identity model: 0 approvals, enforce_admins off,
  no required checks, one shared token (review R2).
- **C6** — Canon pin and update policy: CI SHA binding, plugin auto-update
  locally, who bumps the pin (review R3, A13).
- **C7** — Governance CI gate kept separate from `build.yml`; `ci.yml` carved out
  of the Phase 1 infra scope (review R5; A4 above).
- **C8** — What public-build islands may call at runtime (review R7; ADR-0003).
- **C9** — Handling private content found in a public repository — incident
  runbook (review R8; A1).

## Constraints discovered (bind later contracts)

- **Gate session cookie must be named `__session`** — Firebase Hosting strips
  every other cookie on Cloud Run rewrites. Phase 3 gate contract. (ADR-0004)
- **Gate invoker is `allUsers`** — every check must hold on direct `*.run.app`
  requests. (ADR-0004)
- **Leak-check script location** — brief names `scripts/…` but scopes the site
  agent to `site/**`. Settle in the Phase 3 contract. (ADR-0005)
- **Phase 1 site scope must include** the files the `site/` move touches outside
  `site/**`: `.gitignore`, `.vscode/`, root `package.json`/lockfile removal,
  `scripts/`. (ADR-0001)

## Risks carried forward

1. **Base-path + tree migration (Phase 1).** Current site is GitHub Pages at
   `djjay0131.github.io/website/`, `base: '/website/'`. Moving to `site/` and
   to `/` on `cusati.us` shifts every link, asset and sitemap entry; inbound
   `/website/...` links break. `main` already carries more than the smoke-test
   routes: PR #8 moved research under `/research/soa-agentic-se/**` and added
   `astro.config.mjs` redirects whose targets hardcode `/website/`. Site work owes
   a redirect map and route parity for every route in the current build.
2. **`build.yml`'s hourly `cv` fingerprint reads the Pages URL** — stale once the
   site moves unless repointed in Phase 1.
3. **`gh` and `terraform` are Windows executables not on the WSL PATH** on the
   primary workstation. Contracts must not assume bare `gh` / `terraform`
   locally.
4. **gcloud depends on a uv-managed Python 3.12** via `CLOUDSDK_PYTHON`; uv can
   prune it. A native Linux gcloud is sturdier.
5. **ADC has no quota project** — set it once the project exists.
6. **Project id `cusati-hub` unverified** — keep it a Terraform variable.
7. **System Python is 3.8** vs the gate's 3.12 target — use a uv-managed 3.12
   for Phase 3 tests.
8. **Local and CI canon can diverge.** CI pins canon by SHA; the plugin
   auto-updates locally (delta §Canon Location).
9. **Shared owner token + enforce_admins off** — any agent session can push to
   `main`; the controls are procedural.

## Follow-ups

- The tarball follow-up formerly here (delete it in Phase 3) is **withdrawn**: it
  is now immediate — see Blocked, A1.

## Standing constraints

- Sub-agents: **no git or gh mutations.** They write files and report. The Lead
  Architect alone stages, commits and opens PRs, naming files explicitly.
- Every agent gets a bounded contract in `llm/sprints/2026-09-hub/contracts/`
  **before** it launches; handoffs go to `handoffs/<agent>-<phase>.md`.
- Secrets never touch the repo. WIF only. A key file means **stop and raise at
  the next checkpoint**.
- Ask only design doc §10 questions; everything else is a conservative choice
  recorded above.
- **Agents do not merge.** Draft PR → ready when DoD is met → stop at the
  checkpoint.
